# FUSE
Fast Universal Simulation Engine

FUSE is a fast executing agent-based, discrete event simulation engine. It is the underlying simulation framework for
CHECKMATE and other derived works.

Source code is coming soon. Please be patient as I take a bit of time to refactor this previously private code with 
copyright and license statements.
