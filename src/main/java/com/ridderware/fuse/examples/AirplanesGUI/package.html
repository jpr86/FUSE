        An example showing how to use the Reflector and PaintClickable interfaces provided by the fuse.gui package. 

        <p>
            These interfaces allow the user to directly interact with any method the Agent has access to. This example
            expands upon the bug_gui example by also demonstrating the ability to use true-type fonts to represent your Agent
            visually as well as rotate the Agent. After understanding this example, the only remaining functionality not covered 
            has to do with multiple views and perception.
