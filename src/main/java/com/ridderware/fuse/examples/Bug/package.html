An example of a single agent class with one behavior.

<h2>Bug Example</h2>

<p>
  The Bug example is a simple example provided with
  the fuse simulation framework.  In this example, A Bug class
  extends the base Agent class by adding an X,Y position and by
  defining a "Move" Behavior.  The Move behavior for each Bug
  instance is randomly scheduled within a time range 
  and causes a randomized amount of bug movement.
</p>

<p>
  The Bug instances are created by the BugSim class
  which is an IAgentFactory.
