        This example simply displays several Bugs as they move about, allowing
        the user to click on them and interact with several of their methods.

        <p>
            This example gives the user a basic understanding of the capabilities
            of the fuse.gui package. A simpler example would be possible - it
            would simply return null instead of a Collection of Shapes in the 
            paintClickable method and would not implement the Reflector interface
            at all. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Warning: setting the Bug's location via the GUI outside of the 
            defined Space may render the bug not Viewable as he will be out of the
            displayed bounds.
