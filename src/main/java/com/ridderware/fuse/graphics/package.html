A collection of images and true-type font files that support the fuse.gui
framework.

<h2>Graphics package</h2>

<p>
  Most of the graphics found in fuse.ttf were created by <A HREF="http://www.mapsymbs.com/"Colonel Tom Mouat</A>
  and represent a massive collection of graphics used in simulation packages written on top of the
  FUSE framework. 
</p>

<p>
  Every true-type font file in this directory will soon have a corresponding mapping file (ex. fuse.mapping) that
  will map the name of each symbol to it's unicode representation allowing fuse.gui.FontManager to abstract away
  the need for the end user to manually look up the symbol he wishes to use to represent his GUI'd agent.
</p>

<p>
  The .gif files are used directly by FUSEGUI to represent various icons.
