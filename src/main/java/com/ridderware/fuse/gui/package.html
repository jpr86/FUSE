        The fuse.gui package sits directly on top of the FUSE framework providing means for any Agent to be GUI'd.

        <h2>GUI Package</h2>

        <p>
            To "turn the GUI on" there are 3 requirements:
            <ul>
                <li>Create an instance of Space in which you're Agents should be Viewable. Use a GUIUniverse instead of a SimpleUniverse, passing your Space object
                in the Constructor. The GUIUniverse makes calls to the FUSEGUI singleton allowing it to update the GUI on an event-by-event basis. </li>
                <li>Make your Agents implement an extension of the Paintable interface. Which extension you implement
                yields different levels of functionality. See fuse.gui.PaintViewable and fuse.gui.PaintClickable. 
                Also, see fuse.gui.Reflector to allow the gui-user to interact with your Agent's methods directly.</li>
                <li>Create an extension of the fuse.gui.ViewFrame class (or use the provided SimpleView) and register
                your Agents with the appropriate View. </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        Future Improvements: 
        <ul>
            <li> Let ViewFrame handle all painting, unless Overridden. Use a true double-buffered approach overriding JAVA's update(Graphics g) method. Use a 
            getDrawingImage() funtion to get the BufferedImage from the subclass of ViewFrame that will be drawn on from the actual drawn frame. Make certain Paintables are only called to repaint 
            when necessary. Implement painting that blocks until completed.</li>
            <li> Deprecate and phase out the getMaxBufferSize() method of the Paintable interface. Force all GUI'd agents to return a collection of Shapes when painted.
            On intialization, paint them on a dummy canvas that either (1) represents the max screen size or (2) recomputes the automatically computed buffer size
            on every increasing screen size request from the GUI-user. Use this collection to auto-compute the max required buffer size. </li>
            <li> Add zoom functionality.</li>
            <li> Optimize painting by repainting only affected areas of the canvas by using the Collection of Shapes each Paintable returns.</li>
            <li> Use a MediaTrack to guarantee/block all progress until the Image has been fully painted (probably not necessary since we aren't getting data from over
            a network but this does provide a nice guarantee). </li>
            <li> When using a BufferedImage approach, create an Image once for the background and redraw background only when the user resizes or toggle the drawSpace or drawBoundingBox
            methods of FUSEGUI.</li>
            <li> Create a method by which the FUSEGUI "remembers" how to position its windows to the users-liking.</li>
            <li> Add the ability to create a new View dynamically. </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            <H2> Some Examples are provided </H2>
            <ul>
                <li> fuse.examples.bug_gui The Bug GUI Example (Reflection) </li>
                <li> fuse.examples.airplanes_gui The Airplane GUI Example (Reflection, True Type Fonts)</li>
            </ul>
